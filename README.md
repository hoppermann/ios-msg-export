iOS message export
==================

This small java application can export messages from a iOS backup.
Unfortunately, you have to have an unencrypted backup for reading the data.
Also attached images will be exported.

The application does:
 - reads the contact database
 - read all messages of the contact (joined by email and phone)
 - export the message to a HTML of every contact including the attached images

The iOS backup is located on OS X at

    ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/<phone ID>/

and at Windows (not verified)

    <user directory>\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\<phone ID>\

Usage
-----

    java -cp <lib> msgexport.MsgExportApplication backup-dir [export-dir]

        backup-dir - directory of the unportected backup
        export-dir - directory for the export files (optional)

Issues
